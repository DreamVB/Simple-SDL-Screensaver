# Simple-SDL-Screensaver

This is a project I made after learning about SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
Anyway this shows an example of a very simple screen saver, it supports two styles Snow and Rain. you can add your own easy just by a few tweaks to the source code. I am putting this here in the hope that it will help someone get started in SDL.
